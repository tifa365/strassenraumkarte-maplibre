-- Create labeling lines for highways
-- Basic idea: Dissolve highway lines by name and highway class. Split road labeling lines at main roads.
-- For dual carriageways, pick a representation according to zoom level to prevent duplicate labels
-- (one of both sides for high zoom; for low zoom / main class only: skeleton centerline via
-- CG_ApproximateMedialAxis, buffering all segments of a name+class that has any dual piece).
-- Short *_link segments and short junction connectors without a collinear same-name continuation
-- are dropped so ST_LineMerge can form longer label lines.
-- At junctions with >2 same-name/same-class segments, only a collinear through-pair (+/-25 deg,
-- undirected) shares a merge_id; branches get separate merge_ids so through-lines still dissolve.
-- Before merging, shift segment vertices toward the carriageway center (placement_offset), pinning
-- endpoints that meet same-name/same-class segments so topology for LineMerge is preserved.
-- After dissolve, split long lines into roughly equal pieces (low zoom: max 1500 m,
-- high zoom: max 750 m; prefer cuts at main/minor junctions within 200 m along-line;
-- else ideal interpolate). Then ST_Simplify(1.5) only for lines that include offset≠0
-- source segments (removes offset-pin sawtooth e.g. Okerstraße; leaves pure offset=0
-- chains untouched). Finally, trim 12 m from ends near >=2 main/minor highway geometries
-- (nodes or T-junctions); true dead ends stay full length. Low-zoom lines are main-class
-- only (primary/secondary/tertiary), split at primary/secondary intersections; high-zoom
-- lines cover all classes and split at all main-class intersections. Output is one table
-- label_highway with zoom in ('low','high').
