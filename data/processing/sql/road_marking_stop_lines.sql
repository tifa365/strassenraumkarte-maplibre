-- road_marking_stop_lines.sql — Generates stop lines from stop and traffic signal nodes ("generic")
-- and area:highway junction/crossing areas if present ("junction outline")

-- Depends on: stop_positions (road_azimuth persisted in §3b of this script)
-- Sections: 1)–3) inputs; 2a) junction-area merge; 4) generic (4a)–4c); 5) junction outline (5a)–5b), 5c) with 5c.1)–5c.6); 6) insert into road_marking_way; 7) drop intermediates.
